To enable add filesplus to /etc/nsswitch.conf.  Only add it after
the files option that's already there.  For example:

passwd: file filesplus

This library only supports passwd, shadow, and group.  The default
location for the extra files is /etc/filesplus.  This can be changed
using the /etc/nss-filesplus.cfg file.
